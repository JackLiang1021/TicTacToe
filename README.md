## Tic Tac Toe – C++ Console Project

### Overview

This project is a simple ASCII-based implementation of the classic game *Tic Tac Toe*, developed in C++. It serves as both a fun side project and a personal exercise to re-familiarize myself with C++ programming, particularly object-oriented programming (OOP) principles.

### Purpose

After taking a break from C++, I wanted to return to the language by building something meaningful and clean. This project was designed with OOP best practices in mind—such as the **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**—ensuring each method and class has a well-defined role.

Although I began learning C++ back in 2017, years of not using the language had led me to forget many of its core concepts, especially around classes and design patterns. This project is a stepping stone in my journey to regain and strengthen that knowledge.

### What’s Next?

* **Ultimate Tic Tac Toe**
  I plan to expand this project into a more complex version known as [**Ultimate Tic Tac Toe**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_tic-tac-toe), which introduces strategic layers and nested boards for a more challenging experience.

* **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**
  The next iteration of this game will feature a GUI to replace the ASCII console graphics, making the game more visually engaging and user-friendly.
